# What this app knows about you

Short version: nothing that reaches anybody. There is no account, no sign-in, no
analytics, no advertising, no cookie, and no server of ours that keeps a record of a
visit. What follows is the long version, written from the code rather than from
intention — every claim below is something you can check in the file named beside it.

This is not legal advice and the author is not a lawyer. It is an honest description of
what the software does, so that anyone who needs a legal opinion has accurate facts to
form one from.

## Kept on your device, and only there

Six things are saved in your browser's `localStorage`. They never leave it: nothing in
this project reads them and sends them anywhere.

| Key | What it holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `urbanos_lugo_fav_stops` | the stops you starred |
| `urbanos_lugo_fav_lines` | the lines you starred |
| `urbanos-lugo-recent-stops` | the last stops you opened, as ids |
| `urbanos-lugo-recent-routes` | the last four trips you planned, as you typed them |
| `urbanos-lugo-lang` | Galician, Spanish or English |
| `urbanos-lugo-theme` | light, dark or automatic |

One of those is not like the others. A stop id means nothing without the dataset it
indexes into, but `urbanos-lugo-recent-routes` holds the words you typed — and if you
typed your street, your street is what it holds. It is kept so you do not have to type
the same trip twice, it is capped at four, and "Borrar" beside the list removes it. As
with everything above, nothing in this project reads it back out or sends it anywhere.

Two more are kept in `sessionStorage`, which is different: it survives a reload and is
gone when the tab closes.

| Key | What it holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `urbanos-lugo-trip` | the trip you are on, if you pressed "Vou nesta": its stops, lines and times, and which stops you have passed |
| `urbanos-lugo-reloaded-for` | the address of the page, written only when the page reloaded itself once because a deploy had renamed a file it needed, so it does not do so twice |

The first is there so that locking your phone on the bus does not end the mode. It is written
when you start a trip, removed when you press "Saír da viaxe", and — because it is
`sessionStorage` and not `localStorage` — not left on the device afterwards as a record
of where you went and when.

Clearing your browser's site data removes all of it. There is no copy anywhere else.

## Your location

The app asks for it in five places, and never without you pressing something:
**"stops near me"**, **"use my GPS location"** in the route planner, **"my location"** on
the map, which follows you until you press it again, the **arrival alarm** on a stop's
board, and **"Vou nesta"** on a planned trip, which watches your position for the length
of the ride so it can count the stops you have passed and tell you when to get off. Deny
the permission and the app says so and carries on — it does not fall back to a guess
about where you are.

The map, the alarm and the ride read one and the same watch (`src/services/stopAlarm.ts`):
one GPS client, one permission prompt, and for the alarm and the ride one radius and one
sound. The difference is how long it runs — the map until you press the button again, the
alarm until you reach one stop, the ride until you say you have finished — and in every
case it runs only while the page is open, because a web page cannot wake itself in the
background.

Your position is used in the browser to sort stops by distance and to draw a marker. It
is **not** sent to this project's server, because there is nothing to send it to: the
distance arithmetic is `src/utils/geo.ts`, running on your phone.

**The compass.** Where a map draws your position — "stops near me" and "my location" on
the map — a phone with a compass also shows which way it is facing, as a fan on your dot.
The reading comes from the phone's own orientation sensor, turns that fan and does nothing
else, is read only while the map is on the screen, and is never stored or sent
(`src/services/heading.ts`). On an iPhone, Safari first asks to use "motion and
orientation", in the same tap that asks for your position; refuse it and the dot is drawn
without the fan, as before.

**There used to be an exception here, and there is not any more.** Pressing *"see the
walking path"* sent both ends of each walking leg — one of which can be your GPS position
— to OpenStreetMap's public pedestrian router at `routing.openstreetmap.de`. That is why
it was a button: it was a thing to consent to.

The app now carries the pedestrian network of Lugo itself, 21.093 junctions and 29.489
edges of real pavement built from OpenStreetMap at build time, and works the route out on
your device in under a millisecond (`src/utils/walkRouter.ts`). So the button is gone,
because there is nothing left to agree to, and the walking times you see are measured
along real streets rather than estimated from a straight line — with no connection needed
and nothing sent anywhere.

## What your browser requests from other people

Opening any web page tells the servers it contacts your IP address. This one contacts:

| Host | What for | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tiles.openfreemap.org` | the map background | when you open a map |
| the API, if one is configured | service notices, and the operator's own minutes behind a QR | on the notices screen, and on a stop you reached by scanning |

That is the whole list, and the map is the only one you meet on an ordinary visit. Those
hosts necessarily learn roughly which part of Lugo you are looking at, because that is
what a tile request is. None of them is asked to identify you, and no identifier of ours
travels with any of these requests.

**The typeface used to be on that list** — it came from Google's CDN, so every visit told
Google you had opened a bus timetable. It is served from this site now
(`tools/importFonts.ts`), which changes nothing about what you download and removes the
one third party that was giving neither the map nor the data.

The published site has no API of its own: service notices come from a copy committed by a
scheduled job, and the app says on screen when that copy was taken. Where an API **is**
configured, it is a small service on Deno Deploy (`worker/index.ts`) that reads
buslugo.com on the browser's behalf, because that site refuses a browser directly. (It
read the council's traffic feed too until October 2026; from there the feed never
answered.) It is sent a stop code and nothing else — no identifier, no position.

## If you run the server yourself

`server.ts` keeps request counts per IP address **in memory** so one caller cannot exhaust
the route planner for everybody (`src/security/rateLimit.ts`). It is a `Map` that a timer
sweeps; nothing is written to disk, and restarting the process forgets it. Nothing else
about a request is recorded — there is no access log in this project. A request that fails
with an error inside the server writes its method and path, never its query, to the
server's error output, so the fault can be found; a planned trip's query is what you typed.
When the server reads the council's traffic feed, it writes one line saying whether the feed
answered and how long it took. That line carries nothing of the request that caused it.

Whoever hosts it may of course be keeping their own logs. GitHub Pages does, and so does
Deno Deploy where the API is configured; that is between you and them, and their policies
say what they keep.

## Children

Nothing here is directed at children and nothing asks anyone's age, because nothing asks
anyone anything.

## Changing this

The facts above are checkable and the checks are in `pnpm test`, `pnpm run check:policy`
and `pnpm run audit:browser`. If a future version
sends something new anywhere, this file is wrong until it is updated, and that is a bug
worth reporting like any other.
