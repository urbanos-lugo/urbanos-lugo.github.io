# Whose work this is built on

`LICENSE` covers the code written for this project. It does not cover the libraries the
build bundles into what a visitor downloads, the typeface, or the data — each of those
belongs to somebody else, on their own terms. This file is the code and the typeface;
`DATA.md` is the data, which is the part with the strings attached.

## Bundled into the shipped application

These end up inside the JavaScript a visitor downloads, so their notices travel with it.

BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause and ISC each ask that the copyright notice and the licence
text be kept with redistributions of the source or the binary. A bundler strips comments,
so this table is where they are kept. Each project's full text is in its own package under
`node_modules`, and at the links above.

## Used to build it, not shipped

Vite, esbuild, TypeScript (Apache-2.0), tsx, Express (MIT, and shipped only if you
self-host `server.ts`), and the `@types/*` packages. All MIT except where noted.

## The typeface

**Atkinson Hyperlegible Next** and **Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono**, from the
[Braille Institute of America](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/), designed with
Applied Design Works. It exists because letterforms that are easy to tell apart matter
more to somebody with low vision than a designer's preference does, which is a good reason
to use it on a bus app read at arm's length in the rain.

It is **served from this project**, so the files are redistributed here and the OFL asks
that its text travel with them: `src/fonts/OFL.txt`, carrying the copyright line of both
families. They used to come from Google's CDN, which told Google about every visit for no
benefit a visitor could see — `PRIVACY.md` has the reasoning.

Two files, 51 KB, not eight: these are variable fonts, and Google declares a face per
weight against a single file that the browser instances. `tools/importFonts.ts` fetches
them, keeps one copy per distinct set of bytes, and writes the `@font-face` block. Run
`pnpm fonts:import` and commit what it writes.

## The data, in one line each

The full account, with what each source permits, is in `DATA.md`.

- Timetables, stops and pole codes: transcribed from **buslugo.com** (AULUSA / Grupo
  Monbus). Published for public consultation; no licence stated and no agreement granted
  to this project.
- Route geometry, stop surveys and amenities: **OpenStreetMap contributors**, ODbL 1.0.
  The derived geometry is a Derivative Database and stays under ODbL.
- Map tiles: **OpenFreeMap**, serving the **OpenMapTiles** schema built from OpenStreetMap.
- Routing: the **OSRM** project's public demo server, at build time only. The walking
  network is built from OpenStreetMap at build time as well and routed on the reader's
  own device, so nothing is asked of anybody while the app is being used.
- Ground height, so a walk up a hill costs what a walk up a hill costs: the **MDT05** of
  the **Instituto Geográfico Nacional**, from PNOA-LiDAR — `CC BY 4.0 scne.es`.
- Traffic notices: the traffic RSS feed of the **Concello de Lugo**, read for closures and
  diversions.

## And what this project is not

It is not made, reviewed, endorsed by or affiliated with **AULUSA**, **Grupo Monbus** or
the **Concello de Lugo**. It reads what the operator publishes. Where a timetable matters,
the operator's own page is the authority. The names above are used to say whose service
and whose data this describes — nothing here claims to be theirs.
