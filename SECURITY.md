# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/urbanos-lugo/urbanos-lugo.github.io/security/advisories/new).
Please do not use a public issue for anything exploitable.

Expect a first reply within a week. This is one person's side project, not a staffed
service, and saying so is more useful than promising a turnaround nobody is on call for.

## What is worth reporting

The app is a reader for a public timetable. It has no accounts, no payments and no
server-side personal data. What it keeps is in that browser's own storage and never
leaves the device: favourites, recent stops, the last four trips as typed, the language,
the theme and the trip in progress. `PRIVACY.md` lists every key, and `audit:browser` holds
that list to what the app writes, screen by screen.

So the interesting surface is small:

- **The Express server** in `server.ts`, if you self-host it, and **the Deno worker** in
  `worker/index.ts`, which answers the same two endpoints for the static site when one is
  configured. Both read outside sources on the browser's behalf, because CORS stops the
  browser doing it: buslugo.com, the operator's own stop page behind the QR stickers, and,
  from `server.ts` only, the council's traffic feed (the worker stopped asking it in
  October 2026: from there it never answered). Every one of those reads goes to a fixed host, follows no
  redirect, and is capped at 512 KB and timed out;
  buslugo.com and the feed are read at most once a minute, and the stop page at most 120
  times a minute, per server process or worker instance, however many people ask. Anything
  that gets either of them to read a file, run a command, hammer an outside host, or spend
  a long time on one request is worth a report. `pnpm dev` listens on localhost only, because in
  development Vite serves every file in the working tree, ignored ones included.
- **The Content Security Policy** in `src/security/csp.ts`. If you can execute script in
  a published build, that is a finding regardless of how it got there.
- **The build and its dependencies.** A postinstall script that runs when it should not,
  or anything that could get code into the published artefact through the workflow in
  `.github/workflows/`.

## The worker's address

The static site trusts one origin besides its own: the worker's, `API_ORIGIN`, which the
Content Security Policy admits and the app asks for notices and the operator's minutes.
What comes back is narrowed in the browser before anything is drawn: text as text, and
links only to buslugo.com or concellodelugo.gal. A hostile answer can be wrong about a
notice, but it cannot run script, break the screen or send anyone elsewhere. If the Deno
project or its organization is ever deleted, rebuild the site without `API_ORIGIN` first:
someone else could register the name that was freed, and the site would go on asking it.

## What is not a vulnerability here

- **Times being wrong.** Every hour is labelled with where it came from — published or
  estimated — and the estimates can be minutes out. That is documented, not a defect.
  See "Nunca mentir coas horas" in the README.
- **A stop in the wrong place.** That is a data issue and there is a form for it.
- **Rate limits being reachable.** 120 requests a minute per address is deliberate, and
  the counter is per process. `src/security/rateLimit.ts` says so in as many words.
- **Static files being served without a rate limit.** Code scanning flags the two handlers
  in `server.ts` that touch the filesystem — the pre-compressed asset lookup and the
  single-page fallback — because an unauthenticated caller can make them stat and read
  files. That is what serving a website is. Putting a limiter in front of them would
  throttle an ordinary page load, which fetches about ten files at once, in exchange for
  nothing: the work per request is one `existsSync` and one `sendFile`, both answered from
  the operating system's cache. The published site is on GitHub Pages and never reaches
  this code at all; anyone self-hosting it on the open internet wants a reverse proxy or a
  CDN in front, which is where request flooding is actually handled.
- **buslugo.com being scraped.** It is a public timetable, fetched at most once a minute
  behind a thirty-minute cache, with an honest User-Agent. `DATA.md` covers the terms.

## Supply chain

Dependencies and GitHub Actions are updated weekly by Dependabot. No dependency runs an
install script: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` rules on the one that has one (esbuild, refused),
and a new one stops the install until somebody decides. CI installs with
`--frozen-lockfile` and runs the type check and the test suite before it will build
anything. Every action is pinned to a commit, with its version beside it, and the one job
that holds a deploy token runs an exact Deno and an exact `@deno/deploy`, in the
`deno-deploy` environment: that is where the token belongs, and Settings → Environments
lets only `main` deploy from it. `pnpm run check:policy` fails if any of that comes loose
in the workflows.
