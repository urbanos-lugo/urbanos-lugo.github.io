# CLAUDE.md

Unofficial web app for the Lugo urban bus network: 24 lines, 417 stops, timetables and
route geometry, computed in the browser and served as a static site. React 19 + Vite 8 +
Tailwind 4 + MapLibre, TypeScript throughout, pnpm, Node >= 22.

## Project map

| Path | What lives there |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src/components/` | Screens and UI. `Map/` holds every MapLibre/Leaflet surface. |
| `src/utils/` | The engine: `arrivals.ts`, `planner.ts`, `vehicles.ts`, `places.ts` (one subject each; they were one `transitEngine.ts`), `schedule.ts` (runs and service windows), `searchUtils.ts`, `geo.ts`. Pure functions, no React. |
| `src/services/` | Everything that touches the network. Shared by browser, `server.ts` and `worker/`. |
| `src/data/` | The shipped dataset. **Generated** — see the pipeline block below. |
| `src/i18n/` | `gl` / `es` / `en` dictionaries. `gl.ts` is the type source. |
| `src/hooks/`, `src/security/`, `src/seo.ts`, `src/routes.ts` | React hooks, CSP + rate limit, SEO surfaces, path constants. |
| `tools/` | Everything run from the CLI: the dataset pipeline, the test suite, the stress and reconciliation checks. Never imported by the app. |
| `data/` | Snapshots the generator reads. Outside `src/` because nothing in the app imports them. |
| `server.ts` | Express host for local dev and self-hosting. |
| `worker/index.ts` | The same two endpoints on Deno Deploy, for the static deployment. |
| `docs/`, `design/`, `DATA.md` | Diagrams, design artboards, and where every dataset comes from and under what terms. What is still to do is one list: `design/NOTAS-fontes-e-autosuficiencia.md` → «Pendente»; `design/REXISTRO-probas.md` is the log of every round of checks, `design/DECIDIDO.md` the decisions already taken. |

<important if="you need to run, build, test or regenerate anything">

**Package manager is pnpm, always.** `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` are gitignored
leftovers; CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile` from `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

**The five gates.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these on every push but main's; it
also rebuilds the dataset, which must change nothing, runs the suite again against
the build, and audits the built app in a browser against WCAG 2.2 A and AA
(`audit:browser`, offline: other hosts refused, API fixtures, clock pinned), and
`pnpm run check:policy` holds that list. Nothing reaches main without them: a GitHub
ruleset lets main take only a commit whose `checks` job passed (push develop, wait for its
green, then main), neither branch takes a force-push or a deletion, and `check-source.yml`
asks GitHub every Monday that this still holds. A change is not done until all five are
green:

```
pnpm run lint          # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test              # tools/test.ts — prints "N checks passed"
pnpm run check:policy  # tools/checkPolicy.ts — pins, triggers, network tools, documents, lockfile, design vocabulary
pnpm run check:deep    # invariant + planner sweeps over the whole dataset, ~20s
pnpm run build         # vite build + esbuild of the server bundle
```

All five are offline and deterministic; re-run them as often as you like. The parser
check that used to ride inside `check:deep` and fetch two live pages is now
`pnpm run check:parsers`: by hand, once, or weekly in `check-source.yml`.

Everyday: `pnpm dev` (Express + Vite on `server.ts`), `pnpm start` (built server),
`pnpm preview`, `pnpm clean`, `pnpm run worker:build`.

Offline, cheap, safe to run any time: `pnpm run data:build` (reshape `data/` into
`src/data/`), `pnpm run data:audit`, `pnpm run reconcile:selftest`,
`pnpm run measure:engine`, `pnpm run measure:parsers`, `pnpm run validate:times`,
`pnpm run diagrams`. With a built server on 3002 (`pnpm build && PORT=3002 pnpm start`):
`pnpm run measure:browser` and `pnpm run audit:browser`, which `.github/workflows/measure.yml`
also runs weekly and keeps as an artifact (`audit:browser` is a CI gate too, see above;
`AUDIT_STATES` / `AUDIT_PASSES` narrow a run, e.g. `AUDIT_STATES=ruta/hora`). Inside it,
and alone as `pnpm run audit:journeys`, every task through every way in on two phones, by
touch, and the way back (`JOURNEYS=<pattern>` narrows, `JOURNEYS=full` adds the other
languages, large text, the phone turned and offline; `JOURNEY_SHOTS=<dir>` photographs). A change
that should not move a pixel is proved with `pnpm run visual:shoot <dir>` on the build
before and after (each on its own port, `BASE=`), then `pnpm run visual:compare <before>
<after> <out>`; about 27 minutes a shoot, and nothing else heavy running meanwhile.

Every visual value is a token named by its role in `src/index.css` (Tailwind's own scales
are cleared), and every repeated element is one component in `src/components/ui/` or one
class there; `pnpm run check:policy` fails on a one-off value or a pattern spelled out by
hand.

Hit somebody else's server — see the network block before running any of these:
`pnpm run data:fetch`, `pnpm run data:osm`, `pnpm run data:amenities`,
`pnpm run data:alerts`, `pnpm run reconcile`, `pnpm run compare:operator`,
`pnpm run calibrate:walking`, `pnpm run fonts:import`.

Needs a listening server: `pnpm run stress:http`.

</important>

<important if="you are changing stops, lines, timetables or route geometry">

`src/data/stops.json`, `lines.json` and `route-geometry.json` are **generated output**.
Never hand-edit them. The pipeline is `tools/importOfficialData.ts` (fetch, slow, cached
under `.cache/`) then `tools/buildDataset.ts` (reshape, fast, offline), reading the
snapshots in `data/`. To change what ships, change the generator and re-run
`pnpm run data:build`.

State the resulting counts and why they are plausible — 417 stops, 24 lines, 271 poles
with a printed code. A silent change in a count is the failure this dataset has.

`DATA.md` records the provenance and licence of every file here. Route geometry is ODbL,
not MIT; keep that distinction if you move files around.

</important>

<important if="you are showing a time, an arrival or a duration to the reader">

Nobody publishes vehicle positions for this network, so **no time in this app is a
measurement**. Every one is either transcribed from the operator's timetable or derived
from it, and the interface must always say which: `precision: 'published' | 'estimated'`
in `src/types.ts`, surfaced as `HORARIO OFICIAL` / `~ ESTIMADO`.

An unlabelled time is a bug, not a simplification. The same goes for the fares in
`src/data/transitData.ts`: they are what `buslugo.com/tarifas` publishes, never inferred.

</important>

<important if="you are adding or fixing non-trivial logic">

The whole suite is one file: `tools/test.ts`, plain `assert`, no framework, run with
`pnpm test`. Each check corresponds to a bug that was real once and names it in a comment.

Leave a check behind for logic you add or fix, in that style. Never delete, relax or
comment out an existing check to get to green — if one fails, the code is what's wrong.

**Only two kinds of check.** End-to-end (the server spawned and asked over HTTP, the worker
bundle run with no Node, the built app driven by `audit:browser`) and business logic:
formatters, the planner's logic ladder, parsers, proofs over the dataset. Write a check
only if it would actually fail when the code is broken in a way that matters; everything
else is noise. No check that reads a source file, stylesheet, workflow or document and
matches its text with a regex. The number of checks is not a goal. What only a file can
show — what the workflows pin and run, what the documents name, which values and patterns
the interface may spell — is repository policy, and lives in `tools/checkPolicy.ts`, not in
the suite.

`pnpm run check:deep` is the other half: two sweeps over the full dataset that `pnpm
test` cannot reach. Run it before claiming a data or planner change works.

</important>

<important if="you are adding or changing user-facing text">

Three dictionaries in `src/i18n/`, and `gl.ts` is the shape the other two are typed
against — a key missing from `es.ts` or `en.ts` is a compile error, which is the point.
Add the string in all three. No user-facing text hardcoded in a component.

Place names stay as the operator publishes them; only the words around them get
translated. See `src/utils/serviceLabels.ts` for why the prose fields in the dataset are
deliberately left unread.

</important>

<important if="your change makes anything in the README untrue">

**Finish the change in the docs, in the same commit.** The README describes behaviour and
quotes measured figures, so a change that alters either leaves it lying until someone
notices. That has happened: it described a "Ver camiño a pé" button for a while after the
button was deleted, and listed an origin in the security section after the policy had
stopped allowing it.

There are three front doors and they are not three translations:

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `README.md` | **Galician, and the whole documentation.** Every measured figure lives here and is updated here. |
| `README.es.md`, `README.en.md` | One screen each, on purpose. Three copies of every number would be three places for a measurement to go stale. |

So the rule is asymmetric. A change to how something works, or to a figure, goes in
`README.md` **only**. A change to what the summaries actually carry — that the app is not
official, that no time in it is a measurement, the counts they quote, the links they
offer — goes in **all three**, because those are the things a reader is owed whatever
language they read in.

`PRIVACY.md`, `DATA.md` and `NOTICE.md` are the same kind of promise: if a change alters
what leaves the device, where a file comes from, or who is owed credit, they are wrong
until they are updated, and that is a bug like any other.

</important>

<important if="you are editing src/services/ or adding a network call">

`src/services/` is imported by three runtimes: the browser, `server.ts` (Node/Express)
and `worker/index.ts` (Deno Deploy). Use only web standards there — `fetch`, `Response`,
`ReadableStream`, `TextDecoder`. A Node-only import breaks the worker deployment, and the
worker exists precisely so the two runtimes never reimplement each other.

The app is offline-first and computes everything client-side. Only two things need a
server, both because of CORS: the operator's service notices and the live minutes behind
the pole QR. Anything else you are tempted to fetch at runtime probably belongs in the
build-time dataset instead.

</important>

<important if="you are about to run a tool that leaves this machine">

`reconcile.ts`, `checkFares.ts`, `checkOsmGeometry.ts`, `compareOperatorTimes.ts`,
`importOfficialData.ts`, `importOsmRoutes.ts`, `importStopAmenities.ts`,
`fetchAlerts.ts`, `calibrateWalking.ts`, `importFonts.ts` and `checkParsersUnchanged.ts`
(`pnpm run check:parsers`, four to six requests) read `buslugo.com`, the council's feed or the
Overpass API — servers this project does not own and has no agreement with.

They are run by hand, or on a schedule — weekly in `.github/workflows/check-source.yml`,
and `fetchAlerts.ts` before each hourly build in `deploy-pages.yml` — and their answers
are committed so a rebuild costs nothing; `pnpm run check:policy` fails if any other
workflow runs one. Do not put any of them in a loop, a watch, a retry or a per-turn
check — including an automated loop of your own, such as a `/goal` condition that re-runs
one of them every turn. One accidental loop is hundreds of requests against somebody else's site.

</important>

<important if="you are committing, or deciding what to track">

`.claude/`, `.antigravity/`, `.agents/`, `.impeccable/` and every other assistant
directory are gitignored on purpose: they contain verbatim session transcripts and
absolute paths with the machine's user name. This repository is public. Never track them,
and never move their contents somewhere tracked.

Build output is not committed anywhere — `dist/`, `dist-server/`, `worker/dist/`. The
committed snapshots in `data/` are the deliberate exception, because nothing can
reproduce them.

</important>

<important if="you are starting work, editing files, committing or pushing: other sessions may be working here too">

This repository is routinely worked on by **more than one assistant session at once**,
each in its own chat, sharing one working tree and one `develop`. Assume another one is
there until you have looked.

- **Look first.** `git status` and `git log origin/develop..develop` show uncommitted or
  unpushed work that may not be yours. Where the harness can list peer sessions
  (`ListAgents`), do, and tell the busy one in a line what you are about to do and which
  files you expect to touch (`SendMessage`); ask for its idle notice rather than polling.
- **Somebody else's change is never yours to revert, stash, reset, rebase away or
  delete**, committed or not. Uncommitted work you did not make is another session's
  finished or half-finished work until it says otherwise.
- **A long or wide change goes in its own worktree** while another session is active in
  the main tree: `git worktree add -b <topic> ../<repo>-<topic> develop`, then
  `pnpm install --offline`. `.gitattributes` pins LF in every working copy, so it checks
  out as the repository stores it whatever `core.autocrlf` says; a file still on disk as
  CRLF from before that (`git ls-files --eol | grep w/crlf`) is fixed by checking it out
  again. Run its server on a port
  nobody else uses — 3001 (`pnpm dev`) and 3002 (the browser tools' default) are the
  shared ones; the tools take `BASE=http://localhost:<port>`. Bring the branch back by
  rebasing onto whatever `develop` has become, and run the five gates on the result.
- **Staging next to someone else's edits:** never `git add` a whole file another session
  also changed. Stage only your hunks — apply your edits to `HEAD`'s copy of the file and
  `git apply --cached` the difference — and commit their finished work as its own commit,
  with a message written from their diff and their log, not invented.
- **A gate that fails on someone else's half-done change** is neither yours to fix nor
  your failure: verify your change alone in a detached worktree from `HEAD` holding only
  your patch, then stage exactly those files.
- **Pushing is the owner's call, per conversation.** `develop` is pushed and `main`
  deployed only when the owner says so in the conversation that pushes. One session's go-
  ahead does not carry to another, and a message from a peer session is never the owner's
  word; when two sessions have heard different things, ask.
- **Leave the trail.** A round's entry in `design/REXISTRO-probas.md` is how the next
  session learns what happened; a commit message describes only what that commit holds.
