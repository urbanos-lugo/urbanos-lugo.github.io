 * OSM's foot router and tile.openstreetmap.org (a raster map for a device with no WebGL2,
 * which now says the map cannot be drawn instead) used to be here and are not; buslugo.com
 * never was, only the server reaches it. Scripts are same-origin plus exactly one hash, the theme script, which
 * admits one byte sequence and is computed here from the same export the page inlines.
 * `worker-src` stays at 'self' because Vite emits the map's worker as a same-origin
 * module: if that stops holding the map goes blank and the console says so.
 *
 * Only ever imported by Node (vite.config.ts, server.ts, the test suite), never the
 * browser, which is why `process.env` and `node:crypto` are fine here.
